## Heading ##

  Travelr - The convenient way to go.

## Sub-Heading ##

  An app directed at travelers and tourists. Makes it easy to find relevant weather information for a selected area. Allows users to also calculate currency exchange rates for that area.

## Summary ##

  This product allows an interested traveler to find weather information for their travel destination in real time. Weather is displayed on the page with current and 3 day forecast stats. A convenient currency exchange rate calculator is also included so they can see how much they'll need for their fun filled day!

## Problem ##

  Traveling in a foreign place can be difficult and confusing. Travelr simplifies the distractions of Mother Nature and economics out of vacation and business travels.

## Solution ##

  Our product displays the desired information all in one, easy to interpret location. Often when traveling, people are limited to using their mobile device on the go, and many times without a WiFi connection, using up data, which is also slower. Instead of having to load multiple tabs on multiple pages, Travelr presents the information from multiple resources in one location.

## Quote from You ##

  Travelr cuts above the competition because it's a full-fledged travel companion that provides more than just weather information. Travelr is optimized to run on mobile devices asit is extremely light weight. We designed Travlr to be intuitve and user friendly, and should require very little effort to pull a lot of information

## How to Get Started ##

  Getting started with Travelr is as easy as going to their website and typing in a location. Once you know how much money you'll need for the day, you can convert it back to your native currency, and know how much to bring to the exchange.

## Customer Quote ##

  Travelr gave me the time I needed to close the business deal with Apple. I knew exactly how much money I needed to take with me to be exchanged at the currency exchange location. I was also able to pack all the right attire with having to muck around on the internet on my phone while I was on a video conference.
